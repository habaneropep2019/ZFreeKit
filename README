ZFreeKit is a project to support certain legacy GUI application toolkits and libraries.

Currently, ZFreeKit houses two sub-projects:

- Osiris
- Horus

Osiris is an active fork of Qt2, version 2.3.2. It is currently compiling and running on
modern systems, albeit there are bugs to fix and a lot of work to be done. This is primarily
to support MiDE, although Osiris can be used as a near drop-in replacement for anyone
needing legacy Qt2 support!

Horus houses supporting libraries for a fork of GNOME1, known as FienDE. These include
GTK, glib, etc. It is not being actively maintained at the moment (although it is
planned to be).

*** SECURITY WARNING ***

This repository contains legacy software and source code. It is likely to contain
multiple vulnerabilities. As a one-man team, I'm unable to fully audit the code
at the moment. Vulnerabilities will be fixed as soon as possible. Please report
them on the Issues feature on GitHub.

DO NOT USE on a production system! This software may contain security vulnerabilities,
massive glitches, or other unexpected behaviors.

*** YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! ***

As much as I'd like to not include the above warning, it's the responsible thing to do.
I'm a one-man team, and this project is my side-hobby. It's also a learning experience for
me. While portions of ZFreeKit (namely Osiris) will run and work properly on a modern system,
the code is in some cases a decade old (or older even). It's been no small adventure getting
it running again, and there are surprises that pop up every now and again. I make the best
effort I can to avoid and fix these, but I cannot provide any guarantees!
